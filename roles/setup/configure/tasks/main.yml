# Scanpy (or dependencies) assumes it can write in several directories which the web server won't be able to 
# write to by default, so this can be fixed with:
- name: Find scanpy installation
  shell: "{{ python_venv_name }}/bin/pip show scanpy | grep Location | cut -d':' -f2 | sed 's/^ *//g'"
  register: install_loc

- name: Set permission
  shell:
    chdir: "{{ install_loc.stdout }}/scanpy"
    cmd: 'find ./ -name __pycache__ -exec chmod 777 {} \;'

# Is this necessary? If Scanpy has been installed in our environment as app_user, then this should be sufficient...
# 08.06.22 (gear2) skip this and see what happens...
